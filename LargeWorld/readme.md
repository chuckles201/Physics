These are my notes for [this](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-1-Robert-Resnick/dp/0471320579) textbook. It is uninspired and for a school-setting, yet it is likely a good tool to begin to build an intuition for understanding physics.

It is a textbook I have, so I intend to make do with it.

I am also taking notes on ***The Feynman Lectures*** which offer an inspiring, less concrete take from someone who truly is an inspiration for seeing things clearly and simply.



Here is going to be my method:

1. Read each chapter and *as early/soon as possible*, predict what the formulas are going to be; derive them from scratch, and then see the scientic conesus conclusion brought by the textbook.
2. Investigate further any interesting information/expiriments that warrant it. Build models if needed.
3. Tell interesting stories about what is happening. Treat it lightly, yet rigoursly.
