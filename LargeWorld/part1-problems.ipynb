With the blocks mass, we could use knowledge handed down about the mass of an atom (more on this later) to calculate the number of atoms in the mass. With this, assuming the diameter of each atom touches (longest point), we can:\n",

Assuming no water was lost during the blowing, I know that the surface area would be the surface area divided by the volume, because to obtain 'the volume of the surface area' of the buble, we simply need its original consittuents."
